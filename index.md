## MY PROFILE

My name is Hilda Ngatia.  

I am a 25 year old intelligent, motivated and self-driven individual whose only aim is to strive to do better.   

Professionally, I am a statistician and I am taking my masterâ€™s degree in Biometry at University of Nairobi. My goal is to use the knowledge I have acquired in class and be able to apply it in real life situations.  

My passion is to research, discover and find new ways of solving problems. 

My excellent skills in Mathematics also give me an advantage in using numbers to establish patterns, identify outliers and make informed decisions. 

I also pride myself with being a very logical person who is able to see the bigger picture; I believe it is always important to detach emotions from decision making. 

Besides that, I am a team player and I am always excited to take up new challenges and responsibilities. 

I am efficient and my time management skills are top notch.  

I am always ready to learn new skills and I am always looking for creative ways to solve problems. 

I am always ready to help and serve in any way I can. 

Last but not least, I never leave any stone unturned.
